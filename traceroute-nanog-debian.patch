+.TH TRACEROUTE 8 "March 2004" "NANOG traceroute 6.3.10"
+.SH NAME
+traceroute - print route IP packets follow going to a remote host
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B traceroute \fR[\fI options \fR] \fIhost\fR [ \fIsize\fR ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+Traceroute attempts to trace the route an IP packet follows to some
+internet host.  It finds out intermediate hops by launching probe packets
+with a small time-to-live (TTL) value, and then listens for an ICMP reply
+of \fItime exceeded\fP from an intermediate router.  Traceroute starts
+probing with a TTL of one, and increments by one until an ICMP
+\fIport unreachable\fP reply is received.  This means the probe either
+got through to \fIhost\fP, or hit the maximum TTL.
+.P
+\fIhost\fP is the only mandatory argument, and specifies the target
+system, either as an IP address, or as a host name.  Parameter
+\fIsize\fP determines the size of the probe packets in bytes.
+.P
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+\fB\-a\fR
+Abort after 10 consecutive hops without an answer.
+.TP
+\fB\-d\fR
+Turn on socket level debugging.  This option is only available to the
+super-user (root).
+.\" The option is implemented but the code doesn't use it.
+.\" .TP
+.\" \fB\-f\fR \fIport\fR
+.\" Set source port of outgoing packets to \fIport\fR (default 1000).
+.\" .TP
+.\" \fB\-g\fR \fIhost\fR
+.\" All packets are routed via \fIhost\fR as an intermediate hop.  This
+.\" option may be given at most eight times, and makes use of an IP option
+.\" called Loose Source Recording and Routing (LSRR).  Many routers are
+.\" configured to drop such packets.
+.TP
+\fB\-m\fR \fImax_ttl\fR
+Set the maximum time-to-live (TTL) value that will be used for probing.
+Hosts that are farther than \fImax_ttl\fR hops away will not be traced
+(default 30).
+.TP
+\fB\-n\fR
+Report only IP addresses, but no hostnames.
+.TP
+\fB\-p\fR \fIport\fR
+Start probing at an alternate UDP port (default 33434).  Traceroute
+by default sends out UDP packets with increasing port numbers starting
+at \fIport\fR, and listens for ICMP errors returned from remote hosts.
+This scheme only works if there are no UDP servers listening on the
+probed hosts in the range from \fIport\fR to \fIport + max_ttl\fR.
+.TP
+\fB\-q\fR \fIn\fR
+Send out \fIn\fR queries for each TTL (each intermediate host) (default
+3).
+.TP
+\fB\-r\fR
+Set Dont Route option, advising routers to drop the packets.  In other
+words, only probe within the local subnet.
+.TP
+\fB\-s\fR \fIaddr\fR
+Set source address of outgoing packets to \fIaddr\fR, given either as
+numeric IP address, or as hostname.
+.TP
+\fB\-t\fR \fItos\fR
+Set the type-of-service field in the outgoing IP packets (default 0).
+\fItos\fR is valid in the range of 0 to 255.
+.TP
+\fB\-u\fR
+Use microsecond timestamps.
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fR
+Turn on verbose output.
+.TP
+\fB\-w\fR \fIwait\fR
+Set timeout for replies to \fIwait\fR seconds (default 5 sec).  If no
+ICMP reply is received within \fIwait\fR after a packet has been sent
+out, the probe is considered as failed.
+.TP
+\fB\-A\fR
+Report the Autonomous System Number (ASN) at each hop.  Roughly
+speaking, the ASN tells which administration a router is subject to.
+See RFC 1930 for all the details, and section ENVIRONMENT below on how
+to fine tune the lookup.
+.TP
+\fB\-I\fR \fIproto\fR
+Send out probe packets using IP protocol \fIproto\fR, given either as
+name or numerical value (default UDP).  Some features like parallel
+probing are only available when using UDP.
+.TP
+\fB\-M\fR
+Determine the maximum transfer unit (MTU) along the path.  See RFC 1191
+for details.
+.TP
+\fB\-O\fR
+At each hop, perform a DNS lookup and report the owner as listed in the
+SOA record.
+.TP
+\fB\-P\fR
+Send out multiple probes in parallel.  The default behaviour probes each
+hop in turn, starting from the nearest.  Parallel mode is faster, but
+less reliable.  Many routers rate limit ICMP packets from a single host,
+so dropouts are much more likely in parallel mode, and need not indicate
+a networking problem.
+.TP
+\fB\-Q\fR
+Report detailed statistics on the round trip times at each hop (minimum /
+average +- standard deviation / maximum).  The values
+are given in milli seconds.
+.TP
+\fB\-S\fR \fImin_ttl\fR
+Set the time-to-live (TTL) value in the first packet sent out to
+\fImin_ttl\fR (default 1).  This option determines the first (nearest) host
+that will show up in the trace.
+.TP
+\fB\-T\fR \fIt\fR
+End each line with \fIt\fR instead of a newline.  This comes in handy,
+for example, when including traceroute's output in an HTML page.
+.TP
+\fB\-U\fR
+Move on to probing the next hop as soon as the first successful probe
+arrives.
+.TP
+\fB\-$\fR
+Send out nothing but a single ping with a very large time-to-live.
+.SH DIAGNOSTICS
+Usually the round trip time is printed for each probe at each hop.
+Special symbols denote when something went wrong:
+.TP
+\fB*\fR
+No reply received within \fIwait\fR seconds.
+.TP
+\fB!\fR
+Reply arrived with a time-to-live value of one or lower.
+.TP
+\fB!H\fR
+Received a reply telling that the destination host is unreachable.
+.TP
+\fB!N\fR
+Received a reply telling that the destination network is unreachable.
+.TP
+\fB!P\fR
+Received a reply telling that the desired protocol is unavailable.
+.TP
+\fB!S\fR
+Received a reply telling that source routing failed.  Should never
+occur--unless the probed gateway is screwed.
+.TP
+\fB!F\fR
+Received a reply telling that fragmentation is needed.  Should never
+occur--unless the probed gateway is screwed.

+.RE
+.P
+(I start to see why I'm having so much trouble with mail to
+MIT.)  Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away
+either don't send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them
+with a TTL too small to reach us.  14 - 17 are running the
+MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.  God
+only knows what's going on with 12.
+.P
+The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
+the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3)
+sends an unreachable message using whatever TTL remains in the
+original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining TTL is
+zero, the icmp "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back
+to us.  The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting
+when it appears on the destination system:

+.RE
+.P
+Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final
+destination) and exactly the last half of them are "missing".
+What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)
+is using the TTL from our arriving datagram as the TTL in its
+icmp reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path
+until we probe with a TTL that's at least twice the path length.
+I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.
+.SH ENVIRONMENT
+The lookup process of Autonomous System Numbers (ASN, see option
+\fI-A\fP above) can be configured via several environment variables. By
+default, traceroute issues a whois query on the Routing Assets Database
+(RADB) at \fIwhois.ra.net\fP, which should be sufficient in most cases.
+Chances are that you don't want to change anything here, unless you know
+very well what you are doing.
+.P
+The contents of the following environment variables are limited to
+100 characters at most.  Any trailing characters are silently ignored.
+If unset, compiled-in defaults are used.
+.TP
+\fBRA_SERVER\fP
+Server to issue a RADB whois query on, given either as hostname, or
+dotted-quad IP address.  Defaults to \fIwhois.ra.net\fP.
+.TP
+\fBRA_SERVICE\fP
+TCP port to connect to on the whois server, given either as name or port
+number.  Defaults to \fIwhois\fP.
+.P
+The following variables determine how traceroute attempts to extract an
+ASN from the whois reply.
+.TP
+\fBDATA_DELIMITER\fP
+Each line containing an ASN starts with this tag.  Defaults to
+\fIorigin:\fP.
+.P
+The RADB may contain more than one entry for a given IP address.  To
+find out the correct entry, traceroute has to look up the subnet
+that is the most specific to this IP.
+.TP
+\fBROUTE_DELIMITER\fP
+Each line containing a subnet entry starts with this tag.  Defaults to
+\fIroute:\fP.
+.TP
+\fBPREFIX_DELIMITER\fP
+The network IP and the prefix are separated by this tag.  Defaults to
+\fI/\fP.
+.SH NOTES
+This is not the standard version of traceroute (as included in the netkit
+package), but an alternative implementation maintained by Ehud Gavron. It
+is based on the Van Jacobson/BSD traceroute, and includes additional
+features including AS lookup, TOS support, microsecond timestamps,
+path MTU discovery, and parallel probing.  It is known as trACESroute or
+traceroute-nanog.
